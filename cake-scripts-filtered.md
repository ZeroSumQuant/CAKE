#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Updates voice model from new examples
Usage: python cake-train-voice.py --examples new_messages.json
Retrains similarity model
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Maintains and improves the voice matching model.

## üß™ CAKE-Specific Testing Tools

### cake-simulate-8hour.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Runs mini version of 8-hour test (30 minutes)
Usage: python cake-simulate-8hour.py --duration 30m
Simulates realistic error patterns at accelerated pace
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Tests the specific 8-hour unattended operation requirement.

### cake-trace-intervention.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Traces intervention flow end-to-end with timing
# Usage: ./cake-trace-intervention.sh --error-type ImportError
# Shows each component call with latency
```
**Why Keep**: Tests the specific CAKE intervention workflow with performance metrics.

### cake-simulate-error.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Injects specific error for testing interventions
Usage: python cake-simulate-error.py --type ImportError --module requests
Simulates realistic error conditions
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Creates test scenarios for CAKE's error intervention system.

## üìä CAKE Workflow Automation

### cake-generate-issues.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Reads specification documents and creates GitHub issues automatically
Usage: python cake-generate-issues.py --specs-dir docs/ --repo owner/cake
Creates 150+ issues with proper labels, milestones, and descriptions
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Transforms the specification documents into actionable development tasks.

### cake-check-docs-sync.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Verifies documentation matches implementation
Usage: python cake-check-docs-sync.py
Checks that all documented methods exist and signatures match
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Ensures implementation stays synchronized with specifications.

## üíæ CAKE Database Tools

### cake-db-seed.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Populates database with test data
Usage: python cake-db-seed.py --scenarios all
Creates realistic error patterns and interventions
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Seeds RecallDB with CAKE-specific error patterns and interventions.

## üìà Progress & Monitoring

### cake-ready-to-ship.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Checks all ship criteria from done checklist
Usage: python cake-ready-to-ship.py
Shows checklist with pass/fail for each criterion
"""
```
**Why Keep**: Validates against the specific "done" criteria in cake-done-checklist.md.

## üö´ Scripts Removed (and Why)

### Generic Setup Scripts
- **cake-init.sh**: Project structure already defined in implementation guides
- **cake-setup-dev.sh**: Too generic, standard Python setup
- **cake-create-component.sh**: Redundant with cake-stub-component.py
- **cake-add-adapter.sh**: Redundant with cake-implement-interface.py

### Generic Development Tools
- **cake-update-readme.sh**: Not CAKE-specific
- **cake-find-todo.sh**: Standard grep functionality
- **cake-create-branch.sh**: Standard git workflow
- **cake-pr-checklist.py**: Generic PR process
- **cake-watch-tests.sh**: Standard test watching tools exist

### Generic Build/Deploy
- **cake-build-docker.sh**: Standard Docker commands
- **cake-package-release.py**: Standard Python packaging
- **cake-tag-release.sh**: Standard git tagging

### Over-Engineering
- **cake-do-everything.sh**: Joke script, not practical
- **cake-full-validation.sh**: Can be composed from other scripts
- **cake-pre-commit.sh**: Use standard pre-commit hooks

## Usage Priority

1. **Start with specification-to-code generation**:
   ```bash
   python cake-stub-component.py --spec docs/cake-component-specifications.md --component Controller
   python cake-generate-tests.py --component controller
   ```

2. **Validate implementations**:
   ```bash
   python cake-validate-interface.py --component Controller
   python cake-check-spec-compliance.py --component Controller
   ```

3. **Test CAKE-specific functionality**:
   ```bash
   python cake-check-voice.py --message "Controller: Your tests are failing."
   ./cake-trace-intervention.sh --error-type ImportError
   ```

4. **Track progress**:
   ```bash
   python cake-ready-to-ship.py
   python cake-check-docs-sync.py
   ```

These filtered scripts focus specifically on implementing CAKE as defined in your specification documents, avoiding generic tooling that doesn't add CAKE-specific value.
