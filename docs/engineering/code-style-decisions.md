# CAKE Code Style Decisions

## Docstring Convention

After evaluating multiple docstring styles (Google, NumPy, PEP 257), we chose **PEP 257** for CAKE because:

1. **It's the Python standard** - PEP 257 is the official Python Enhancement Proposal for docstrings
2. **It's flexible** - Allows docstring summary on the same line as opening quotes, which is more concise
3. **It matches our existing code** - No need to reformat 500+ docstrings
4. **It's AI-friendly** - Clear and concise, making it easier for LLMs to parse and understand

### Example

```python
def process_intervention(self, error: str) -> str:
    """Generate appropriate intervention for the error.
    
    Args:
        error: The error message to process
        
    Returns:
        Intervention message in Dustin's voice
    """
```

## Why This Matters

When building autonomous AI systems like CAKE, consistency reduces cognitive load. Every decision should optimize for:
- Clarity for both humans and AI
- Maintainability at scale  
- Pragmatism over dogma

## Other Style Choices

- **Line length**: 100 chars (balanced for modern monitors)
- **Formatter**: Black (no debates, just consistency)
- **Import sorting**: isort with Black profile
- **Type hints**: Required for public APIs, optional for internal helpers
