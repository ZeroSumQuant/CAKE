## Script Standards

All scripts follow these conventions:

1. **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times safely
2. **Help Flag**: `--help` shows usage and examples
3. **Output Formats**: Human-readable by default, `--json` for automation
4. **Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 1 for failure, 2 for warnings
5. **Logging**: Uses `--verbose` for debug output
6. **Dry Run**: `--dry-run` shows what would happen
7. **Configuration**: Reads from `.cake-scripts.yml` for defaults

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the scripts repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cake-scripts.git
cd cake-scripts

# Make all scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh
chmod +x *.py

# Add to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)

# Or install system-wide
sudo make install
```
