## üìã Today's Progress

### Tasks Discussed in Conversation
- Change to cake project
- Navigate to the correct directory before we begin our session
- Be in the cake project
- Learn how to use claude code correctly
- Read through the files and tell me what you think
- Explore the cake directory structure to see what components have been implemented
- Implement the core components like operator, recalldb, ptyshim, validator, watchdog, and cakecontroller
- Test issue we created from the repo, we were working on creating a custom parser for the workflow script, youll have to read out handoff docs and task log to get full understanding of what im talking about ‚úì
- Create a new branch for this issue
- Create faithful and accurate documents

### Decisions Made
- help you switch to the CAKE project
- first check what's in your current directory and then locate the CAKE project
- look for the CAKE project in your GitHub folder
- work with the CAKE project files using their full paths
- start with the key documentation files
- explore CAKE to understand how it will help me work autonomously
- explore the CAKE directory structure to see what components have been implemented
- start by examining the project structure
- check the content of these __init__
- be able to work on complex projects like LUCA with minimal interruption, self-correcting issues as they arise

### Problems Solved
- No problems recorded

### Key Insights
- always check which project we're working on and read the right CLAUDE
