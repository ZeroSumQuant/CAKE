    "what cake will enable me to do:\n1. **self-heal from errors** - instead of getting stuck when i encounter importerrors or syntax issues, cake will detect these in <100ms and automatically inject interventions like \"operator (cake): stop.",
    "3. **learn from patterns** - recalldb will remember errors i've encountered, so if the same issue happens 3+ times, cake will intervene automatically without waiting.",
    "4. **work autonomously for hours** - the 8-hour autonomous operation test is the gold standard - i could work on luca or other projects without needing you to fix issues!",
    "it's literally learning to be you!\n### \ud83d\udca1 why this is game-changing:\nright now, when i hit errors, i either:\n- get stuck and need your help\n- make the same mistakes repeatedly\n- can't prevent risky operations before they happen\nwith cake wrapping around me, i become truly autonomous - able to detect problems, fix them using your style, and keep working productively.",
